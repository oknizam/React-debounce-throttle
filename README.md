# throtteling
Let's assume that we have an event listener in our app to track the movement of the user mouse, then send data to a backend server to do some operations based on the location of the mouse.

const handleMouseMove = (e) => {
  //everytime the mouse moved this function will be invoked
  console.log('api call to do some operations...')
}
//event listener to track the movement of the mouse
window.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove)
If we stick with this solution, we will end up with a down backend server because it will receive a hundred of requests in short duration.



1600 API calls in few seconds is very very bad ðŸ“›ðŸ“›ðŸ“›. To fix this issue, we need to limit the number of API calls, and this kind of problems can be solved using a throttle function.



A throttle function is a mechanism to limit the number of calls of another function in a specific interval, any additional calls within the specified time interval will be ignored.

function throttle(fn, delay) {
  let run = false
  return function (...args) {
    if (!run) {
      fn(...args)
      run = true
      setTimeout(() => (run = false), delay)
    }
  }
}
The throttle function accepts two arguments: fn, which is a function to throttle, and delay in ms of the throttling interval and returns a throttled function.

Implement throttle function into our example
const handleMouseMove = (e) => {
  //everytime the mouse moved this function will be invoked
  console.log('api call to do some operations...')
}

//event listener to track the movement of the mouse
window.addEventListener('mousemove', throttle(handleMouseMove, 1000))
//1000ms => 1 second
